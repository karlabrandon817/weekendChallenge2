Assignment Details
------------------
The goal of this assignment is to first make an Ajax call from the client side app.js using an .ajax method and access the JSON data through a provided url. When successful, this will bring the data back down for use. This task will combine what I have learned about parsing objects and arrays to complete the challenge.

One object (person) will be represented on the DOM at a time (info from the JSON data). On the screen will be "previous" and "next" buttons, that when pressed, will show the information for the appropriate person (object). These should wrap, meaning "previous" when on the first person should wrap around to show the last person and vice versa.

Also on the DOM will be displayed a number showing the number of people total and the number currently being viewed (e.g. "2/20").

When a person is displayed, their name and info will be shown. Only one person should be shown at any given time.

*** Must enable cross-origin resource sharing!
